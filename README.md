# City of Missoula - Department of Transportation

The City of Missoula consucted a transportation survey inspired by the Seattle transportation survey. Although many questions were asked regarding the trasportation choices and patterns of people along with a few demographic information, the main aim of the survey was to see if people would be interested in an app that would help them choose more sustainable modes of transport.

A preview of the survey can be found [here](https://missoulaparks.qualtrics.com/jfe/preview/previewId/f77cbedb-4863-4bd0-96d7-629c03e4a169/SV_1NsyG54i5twwOk6?Q_CHL=preview&Q_SurveyVersionID=current).

My task was to conduct an analysis on the survey results and deliver any insights back to the client through three formats. A digital product, a final presentation, and a scientific paper. This repository holds the documents for the analysis done on the scientific paper. 

> Like a kid chasing a crab on a shore that is full of crabs, there were numerous ideas to pursue at first. Eventually, I settled with a few research questions to consider.

**Question 1.) Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost Analysis Code:**

This process wasn't exactly designed properly. The survey was designed without consulting a data scientist and the survey responses sometimes are in formats we cannot use. More insight should have gone into how the survey was designed and what questions were asked. But, what if we could turn this negative into a positive? What if we could build a model that will predict what variables are good at predicting if someone would be interested in an app that would offer sustainable modes of transport? This would give us an insight into what questions in the survey were great at what we were trying to find and when it is time to run the survey again, we could make improvements on the survey by asking more questions that worked. This will also give us an insight into what type of people are interested in our product and who we should focus on.

Code for this task can be found in the file named "Analysis_Code_BoscoLouis_20250309".


**Question 2.) Chi-Squared analysis Code:**

One question in the survey asked the survey takers to rank certain things based on their importance. They were things like time, cost, reliability, etc. We have certain demographic information about the respondents. Is there a relationship between these two? In other words, is there a pattern on how certain groups of people rank things based on importance?

Code for this task is coming soon.

**Question 3.) Categorization Code:**

There are two columns in the survey where people have given their input in text strings. The two questions were;
Does you mode of transport change seasonally? If so, explain how.
Do you have any general comments about trasportation in Missoula?
Going through each individual reply is a painfully laborous task. What if we used LLMs to summarize the meaning in these columns for us?

Code for this task can be found in the file named "Categorization_Code_BoscoLouis_20250309".

**Question 4.) TBD**
