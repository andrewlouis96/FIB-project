Nothing yet.

I'm going to put together an initial plan on how i'm going to bring this project together and how/what deliverables would be best.

How many hours did you spend working on your Capstone since last week’s post?

and what requirements they have for the dashboard.

Progress: What have you accomplished since last week’s post?

Brainstormed with my boss and decided on a couple ideas for the project.
One was a model to recognize merchant names and another to find recurring transations to infer subcription services.
We finally decided on scoring or evaluating different models to find the best credit risk scoring model that will best fit our needs.
We drafted our proposal and sent it to the Risk and Compliance team for approval.

Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?

The Complaince team rejected our proposal. My boss has worked with students from the university in Bozeman before so he was pretty confident there would be no issues.
However, it seems things have changed since then. We had already starting working on the merchant recognition model and had written code in python.
Pretty disappointed with the people I work for right now.

Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?

I've been scouting kaggle to see if I can find any interesting data there. no hope so far.

How many hours did you spend working on your Capstone since last week’s post?

I'd say about 10 hours in total since last class.
