They have been out of the office this past week and just got back to my messages on Monday. I told them we need the data in SASS from Qualtrics.
They said that they actuallu used Parks and Recs account in Qualtrics to run their survey. So, she needs to reach out to them in order to get
what is needed. I suspect I will get the data next week.

Acquiring what's needed and communicating with my clients has been the hardest park so far. Hopefully, things get better from here.

Brainstorm with Simona once we can get our hands on the data and explore the possibilities.

Progress: What have you accomplished since last week’s post?

Brainstormed with my boss and decided on a couple ideas for the project.
One was a model to recognize merchant names and another to find recurring transations to infer subcription services.
We finally decided on scoring or evaluating different models to find the best credit risk scoring model that will best fit our needs.
We drafted our proposal and sent it to the Risk and Compliance team for approval.

Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?

The Complaince team rejected our proposal. My boss has worked with students from the university in Bozeman before so he was pretty confident there would be no issues.
However, it seems things have changed since then. We had already starting working on the merchant recognition model and had written code in python.
Pretty disappointed with the people I work for right now.

Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?

I've been scouting kaggle to see if I can find any interesting data there. no hope so far.
